## 🌐 Demo

Here is a working live demo: https://cohort5-code-fam-car-rent.vercel.app/

## 📝 Description

Morent, a cutting-edge car rental application that was developed using the MERN stack. The app boasts a dynamic homepage that showcases featured vehicles, along with convenient pickup & drop-off location options & a comprehensive list of available cars.

My team and I also developed the car listing page which offers a search bar and various filtering options for users to find the perfect vehicle.

Car owners are also able to list their cars for rent through our Add Car page, while users can easily track their rented and rented-out cars through their profile page.
